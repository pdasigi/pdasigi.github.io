          <p>I am a senior research scientist on the <a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team
          at the <a href="https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI</a>.</p>
          
          <p>I work on building usable language technologies. I have been actively involved in developing <a href="https://allenai.org/olmo">OLMo</a>.
          My current research interests lie in adapting language models for general use with minimal human effort. I have previously worked on
          information-seeking question answering, reading comprehension, executable semantic parsing, and efficiently collecting datasets for all
          these tasks. Checkout
          <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Pradeep-Dasigi/2697425?sort=pub-date">my papers</a> for an up-to-date overview of my
          research.</p>
          
          <p>I have a PhD from the <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">Language Technologies
          Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I wrote a <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf">thesis</a>
          on Knowledge-Aware Natural Language Understanding, and a Masters degree from
          <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>.</p>
          
          <p>I used to be a frequent host on the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights">NLP Highlights</a> podcast along with other members
          of the AllenNLP team.</p>
