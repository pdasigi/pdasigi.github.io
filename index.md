---

<p>I am a research scientist on the <a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team
at the <a href="https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI</a>. I have been actively involved in developing open language models,
<a href="https://allenai.org/olmo">OLMo</a> and <a href="https://allenai.org/tulu">Tulu</a>.
My current <a href="research.html">research</a> focus is on post-training language models. I am generally passionate about adapting language models for general use with minimal human effort.</p>
      
<p>I used to be a frequent host on the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights">NLP Highlights</a> podcast along with other members
of the AllenNLP team.</p>
